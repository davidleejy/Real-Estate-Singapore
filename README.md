## Interactive Maps
- [Teoalida](https://www.teoalida.com/singapore/hdbmap/) offers an interactive map that displays the locations of HDB flats and condominium buildings, with comprehensive details about each property. 
- [HDB's Map Services](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/fi10/emap.html) provides information about HDB's flats, car parks, shops and businesses with a somewhat dated user interface at the time of writing.
- [URA's private residential property map](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=ptyprices) provides information about private housing sale transactions with caveats lodged or options issued, and private housing rental contracts. Sale, subsale, and resale transactions info are updated weekly. Rental contracts info is updated monthly.
- [URA's Government Land Sales map](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=glsrelease) provides information on upcoming and sold sites under the GLS (Government Land Sale) programme. URA acts as agent for the State in carrying out land sales for commercial, hotel and private residential developments. The release of State land is carried out through the GLS programme.
- [URA's demographics map](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=demographics) provides the demographic statistics (age, gender) in individual planning subzones.

## Transactions
- EdgeProp lists individual profitable & unprofitable sales transactions together with their profit & loss dollar amounts. For example, the subheader entries "Profitable Sales" & "Unprofitable Sales" are situated about one-third the way down the page for the condominium [Reflections at Keppel Bay](https://www.edgeprop.sg/condo-apartment/reflections-at-keppel-bay).
- [HDB's market rental rates database](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BR12AWRentalEnq/BR12PSearch.jsp) lets you search for the rental rates of _whole_ HDB flats _rented out by flat owners_ in the past one year.
- [URA REALIS database](https://www.ura.gov.sg/reis/index) provides data on private residential property transactions. (Paid resource)
- [data.gov.sg HDB resale transaction data](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/datasets/d_8b84c4ee58e3cfc0ece0d773c8ca6abc/view) contains HDB resale transacted prices starting from January 1990 to the recent present.
- [EdgeProp's Market Watch](https://www.edgeprop.sg/market-watch/median-prices) lists the latest quarter's median transacted prices and rents.  

## Legal Matters
- [CEA's Public Register of Property Agents & Businesses](https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/sales/1) lets you check whether a person is a registered salesperson (commonly known as property agents), or whether a business is a licensed estate agent (commonly known as property agencies). In Singapore, salespersons and estate agents must possess a valid licence or registration granted by the CEA before they are allowed to conduct estate agency work.
